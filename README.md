## Native Action Scheduler

![marketplace](/assets/MarketPlaceIcon.png)

Schedule Actions in your Native app, just like the [Action Scheduler](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/202363)

## Features

- Switch Scheduler on/off with a Boolean expression
- Set Scheduler interval with a Long expression
- Set the action (Open page, Nanoflow, Microflow, etc...)
- Set the scheduler to run once (the interval will act as a delay)

## Example

![](/assets/page.png)
![](/assets/widget.png)

- I have configured a Dataview with a `Counter` (Number) and `Enabled` (Boolean)
- I let the Native Action Scheduler execute a Nanoflow every seccond (1000ms), while `Enabled` is true
